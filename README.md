# ng-phone-app

It's attempt - unfortunately, to combine ng-material with cordova to provide multiplatform mobile app stack. 
At most it fails because of XWalk usage which is needed to proper render ng-material directives and its running
only with Android. That's not all - despite that inconvenience some CSS styles fails in mobile chromium browser.
